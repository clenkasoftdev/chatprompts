# chatprompts
Using AI speeds up productivity. It may also produce the wrong things without proper guidance.
One way to get the best out of the LLMs is to guide them with proper prompting.

In this project, I shall add useful prompts that I find productive and explain their usage.
## 1. Beast Mode
I find this prompt developed by Burk Holland very useful.
I do not let it go while though. I sit there and confirm its major actions.
### Usage in VS code
- Switch to agent mode
- In the drop down, go to "Configure agent mode" and create a new .md file. It could be local for the project or for your user (and valid for all projects). Paste the content in it and save and you are good to go.

### Usage in Visual studio
- Create a .github folder
- In the folder, create a copilot-instructions.md file and drop the contents there.
